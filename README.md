This project focuses on developing an **online Inventory Management System (IMS)** for a **departmental store**. The system is designed to **store and manage inventory details**, update stock levels based on sales transactions, generate **sales receipts**, and produce **inventory and sales reports** at regular intervals.

The IMS is a **comprehensive, integrated platform** catering to both **users** (such as salespersons, sales managers, and inventory managers) and **administrators**. While general users can manage sales and inventory updates, administrators have the ability to perform higher-level functions, including **adding new inventory items, updating product prices, and managing system settings**.

The system supports **multiple terminals**, features an **intuitive GUI interface**, and is connected to a **centralized database** to ensure seamless data synchronization and accessibility across different users.
